🔹 CIA Triad (Core Principles)

The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity:

Confidentiality → Ensures data is only accessible to authorized users.

Integrity → Ensures data is accurate and has not been tampered with.

Availability → Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.

========================
💀 Malware

Harmful software (virus, worm, trojan, spyware)

🚩 Red Flags: Unexpected files, pop-ups, slow system

✅ Good Practices: Use antivirus, update software, avoid unknown downloads
========================

🎣 Phishing

Fake emails/messages tricking users

🚩 Red Flags: Suspicious sender, urgent tone, unknown links/attachments

✅ Good Practices: Verify sender, don’t click unknown links, enable 2FA
========================

💰 Ransomware

Encrypts/locks data, demands payment

🚩 Red Flags: Files suddenly inaccessible, ransom note

✅ Good Practices: Backup files offline, keep software updated, use antivirus

========================
🌐 DDoS

Overloads systems, makes them unavailable

🚩 Red Flags: Slow/unresponsive websites

✅ Good Practices: Use firewalls, rate limiting, cloud DDoS protection

========================
💻 SQL Injection (SQLi)

Injects malicious code into databases

🚩 Red Flags: Unexpected database errors

✅ Good Practices: Use parameterized queries, validate inputs, patch software

========================
🖥️ XSS

Injects scripts into websites

🚩 Red Flags: Unexpected pop-ups, URL changes

✅ Good Practices: Sanitize user inputs, enable Content Security Policy (CSP)

========================
🎯 Advanced Threats / APT

Sophisticated, persistent attacks

🚩 Red Flags: Unusual network activity, multiple failed logins

✅ Good Practices: Network monitoring, intrusion detection, strong access controls

========================
👤 Internal Threats

Threats from employees/insiders

🚩 Red Flags: Unauthorized access attempts, policy violations

✅ Good Practices: Least privilege access, monitoring, audits, employee training
========================

Basic Security Practices for Everyone:

 1) Use strong, unique passwords

 2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

 3) Keep software and systems updated

 4) Be careful with unknown links, files, emails

 5) Backup important data regularly

 6) Monitor accounts and logs for suspicious activity
